# Linked Project

Since a few years ago, I started to spot interesting projects or article on the web, or similar to my thought.
I will say a few word here about each I remember.

*This article is still under construction*

## Node.js

Ok, we got the same name, however, the concept is very different think.
I don't want the developer or the user to bother about information transfer, and make them think every bit is local.
Node is the opposite, it let the developer manage every transaction.

## Display, Storage & Network

I remember about an article I read a few months (years ?) ago about the new mobile devices against old personal computer, and this three characteristic to understand about distributed computing.
I, unfortunately, don't remember any title or link to this article.

## ifttt

ifttt is a system that let you program action on specific trigger.
In a certain way, it's similar to the linking system I thought about.
Because every bit of data will be local, or very accessible, you can put trigger on them, like you put scripts on OS actions.

## 10/GUI

10/GUI is a concept about a new paradigm of GUI for which we would use our 10 finger.
There is no more resizable windows, instead there is kinds of tabs.

## Chorded Keyboard

http://labs.teague.com/projects/ChordedKeyboard/
Doug Englebart invention : a one hand keyboard, pretty clever.

## Geckoboard

Geckoboard is a simple dashboard gathering pretty every piece of tool you need as webmaster to monitor traffic, mails, social media etc...
The idea is great, it would be good to rethink it for everyone, not only webmaster and internet nerds.

## Slidescreen

Slidescreen is a very cool and smart homescreen for android, made by LavaLabs.
Great inspiration.
